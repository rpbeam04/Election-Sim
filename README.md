### Canadian Election Sim

This webapp is a simple Canadian election simulator. Most of the code is from ChatGPT but it is a cool little webapp to watch pretty colors populate a map.

The sliders roughly correspond to probabilities but due to the baseline model for riding ideological leanings, there is a correlation between the left leaning and right leaning party sliders when coordinated. These effects are fun to discovrer and play with, so try to get different governments in parliament!
